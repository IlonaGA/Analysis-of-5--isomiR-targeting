# Analysis-of-5-isomiR-targeting
### Aim 
To analyse and identify 5’-isomiRs with significant targeting activity in a given set of samples with available isomiR/mRNA expression data.

### Repository description


### Results:
- 38% of highly expressed isomiRs (63 entries) were expressed in 10 or more cancer types, including 11 non-canonical 5’-isomiRs;  
- Was shown that high expression of a non-canonical 5’-isomiR is tied with the high expression of its corresponding canonical form;  
- Activity of 5’-isomiRs adjusted for background correlation effects was infered;  
- The 5’-isomiR-gene interaction networks for each cancer from TCGA were constructed;  
- For a given 5’-isomiR and cancer type broad 5’-isomiR targeting activity was denoted.
